I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electronic Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)&thinsp;(SJTU). During my Ph.D. study, I visited the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/)&thinsp;(DTU) for one year and a half, where I work with [Søren Hauberg](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~sohau/) and [Jes Frellsen](https://frellsen.org/). Before joining SJTU in Sep 2016, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/).
My research interests mainly focus on generative models and their applications. I'm also committed to exploring the geometric and distribution properties of data manifolds through generative models.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
