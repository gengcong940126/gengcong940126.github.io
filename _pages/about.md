I am currently an AI algorithm researcher at China Mobile Research Institute. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/)&thinsp;(SJTU). During my Ph.D. study, I visited the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english/)&thinsp;(DTU) for one year and a half, where I worked with [Søren Hauberg](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~sohau/) and [Jes Frellsen](https://frellsen.org/). Before joining SJTU in Sep 2016, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/)&thinsp;(UESTC).  
My research interests mainly focus on generative models and their applications. I'm also committed to exploring the geometric and distribution properties of data manifolds through generative models.
